To test TypeScript projects, you need to use the TypeScript compiler (often denoded by tsc). 

The steps to take are listed below:
1. Go to the directory in your terminal

2. In the terminal, Run the command: 
`tsc index.ts`

This command compiles the TypeScript file and generates an index.js file


3. While still in the terminal, you want to run the command:
 `node index.js`

The output of your TypeScript file should display in the terminal if everything was done correctly
