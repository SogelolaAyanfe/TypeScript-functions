<!-- To test TypeScript projects, you need to use the TypeScript compiler (often denoded by tsc). 
This compiler is a command tool to transform a TypeScript code to a JavaScript that makes it readable for web browsers and Node.js enviroments.
The steps to take are listed below:
1. Go to the terminal and ensure the directory is the right directory of the TypeScript project

2. In the terminal, Run the code: 
tsc <typeScript-file-name.ts>

NB: This <typeScript-file-name.ts> is just a placeholder to contain the actual name of the file you want to compile.
3. While still in the terminal, you want to run the code:
 node <typeScript-file-name.ts>

The output of your TypeScript file should display in the terminal if everything was done -->
